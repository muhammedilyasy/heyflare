/**
 * The week — HEY Calendar's desktop home, rebuilt from the real thing.
 *
 * It is not one week. It is a **vertical stack of week rows** that runs on forever in both
 * directions: you scroll through the year the way you scroll through a document, and the week you
 * are currently pointed at is the one wearing a thin rounded frame.
 *
 * Each row is a self-contained week. Top to bottom:
 *
 *   · a habit rail — a hairline per day column with that day's habit buttons straddling it;
 *   · the day headers, right-aligned, small, today reversed out of a filled blob;
 *   · the timed body: seven columns, the **whole 24 hours, dead linear**, about 19px to the hour;
 *   · "SOMETIME THIS WEEK:", this week's flexible tasks, always present even when empty.
 *
 * Two things this view deliberately does *not* do, both of which belong to the day view:
 *
 *  1. **No night compression.** 1AM sits near the top of the column and 10:30PM near the bottom,
 *     on one unbroken ruler. A week is for seeing shape across days, and a kinked axis would make
 *     Tuesday's evening a different size from Wednesday's.
 *
 *  2. **No free-time bands and no duration stamps.** The ground is plain. There is also no hour
 *     gutter and there are no hour rules — nothing in a column but events.
