 * A cold load used to sit on skeletons until the Imbox, counts and screener round-tripped — even
 * though that's the same data the last visit already had. Paint from a localStorage copy instead;
 * the queries above still refetch right away (they're already older than `staleTime`), so this only
 * changes what's on screen while that happens, not what data ends up there.
 *
 * Deliberately small: only list-shaped, sidebar-shaped data, never `thread` (full HTML bodies) or
 * `search` — those stay network-only so one big thread can't blow the ~5MB localStorage quota.
 * The calendar's own keys (`calRange`, `calDay`, `calSettings`, …) all start with "cal" — see the
 * comment on `keys` in api.ts — and events are small text fields, so the whole family is cheap to
 * keep: a visited month/day paints from the last snapshot instead of a blank grid while it refetches.
 * `clearPersistedCache` (lib/persistedCache.ts) drops the same `PERSIST_KEY` on logout.
